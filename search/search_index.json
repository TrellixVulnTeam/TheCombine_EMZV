Sorting and Filtering Columns The columns are: Actions, Vernacular, Senses, Glosses, Domains, Pronunciations, Note, Flag, and Delete. At the top of columns with predominantly text content (Vernacular, Glosses, Domains, Note, or Flag), you can sort alphabetically or filter with a text search. At the top of the Senses and Pronunciations columns, you can sort or filter by the number of senses or recordings that entries have. There is also a Definitions column that can be turned on or off in Project Settings . Editing Entry Rows You can record, play, or delete an entry's audio recordings with the icons in the Pronunciations column. You can delete an entire entry with the icon in the Delete column. To edit an entry's vernacular form, senses (including glosses and domains), note, or flag, click the icon in the Actions column. Merge Duplicates This tool automatically finds sets of potential duplicate entries. First it presents sets of words with identical vernacular forms. Then it presents sets with similar vernacular forms or identical glosses (or definitions). Each entry is displayed in one column, and each sense of that entry is displayed as a card that you can click-and-drag. There are three basic things you can do with a sense: move it, merge it with another sense, or delete it. Move a Sense When you click-and-hold a sense card, it turns green. You can drag-and-drop the sense card to a different place in the same column to reorder the senses of that entry. Or you can drag-and-drop the sense card to a different column to move the sense into that other entry. If you want to split an entry with multiple senses into multiple entries, you can drag one of the sense cards into the empty extra column on the right. Merge a Sense If you drag a sense card over another sense card, the other sense card also turns green. Dropping a sense card onto another sense card (when they are both green) merges the senses. This causes a blue sidebar to appear on the right, showing what senses are being merged. Important When multiple senses are merged, all semantic domains are preserved, but only the top sense in the sidebar has its glosses (and definitions) preserved. You can drag-and-drop sense cards to or from the sidebar to change which senses are being merged. Or within the sidebar, you can move a different sense to the top (to preserve its glosses). Click on the right angle bracket (>) to close or open the blue sidebar. Delete a Sense To delete a sense entirely, drag its card to the garbage can icon in the lower-left corner. When the sense card turns red, release. If you delete the only remaining sense of a column, the whole column will disappear, and that entire entry will be deleted when you save. Flag an Entry There is a flag icon at the top-right corner of every column (to the right of the vernacular form). You can click on the flag icon to flag the entry for future inspection or editing. (You can sort flagged entries in Review Entries .) When you flag an entry, you are given the option to add text. Whether or not any text is typed, you will know that the entry is flagged because the flag icon will be solid red. If you added text, you can hover your cursor over the flag to see the text. Click on the red flag icon to edit the text or remove the flag. Finishing a Set There are two buttons at the bottom for wrapping up work on the current set of potential duplicates and moving on to the next set: \"Save & Continue\" and \"Skip\". Save & Continue The blue \"Save and Continue\" button does two things. First, it saves all changes made (i.e., all moved, merged, or deleted senses), updating the words in the database. Second, it saves any unmerged words as non-duplicates. Tip Are the potential duplicates not duplicates? Just click Save & Continue to tell The Combine not to show you that set again. Note If one of the words in an intentionally unmerged set is edited (e.g., in Review Entries), then the set can appear again as potential duplicates. Skip The grey \"Skip\" button resets any changes made to the set of potential duplicates. The same set will be suggested again the next time Merge Duplicates is opened. Create Character Inventory Character Inventory tools are only available to project admins. Create Character Inventory provides an overview of every unicode character that appears in the vernacular forms of the project's entries. This allows you to identify which characters are commonly used in the language, and to \"accept\" them as part of the language's character inventory. The character inventory is part of the LDML file for a project's vernacular language that is included when the project is exported . Accepting characters will lead to accurate representation of the language in Unicode, the Ethnologue, and other language standards and resources. Another use of Create Character Inventory is to identify and replace characters that have incorrectly been used in typing vernacular forms of words. There is a tile for each unicode character that appears in the vernacular form of any entry. Each tile shows the character, its Unicode \"U+\" value, the number of times it occurs in entry vernacular forms, and its designation (default: Undecided). Manage a Single Character Click on a character tile to open a panel for that character. Tip You may have to scroll to see the panel. If your window is wide enough, there will be a blank margin on the right; the panel will be at the top of this. If your window is narrow, tiles fill all the way to the right side of the window; the panel will be at the bottom, below all the tiles. The middle of the panel shows up to 5 example vernacular forms in which the character occurs, highlighting the character in each occurrence. At the top of the panel are three buttons for designating whether the character should be included in the vernacular language's character inventory: \"ACCEPT\", \"UNDECIDED\", and \"REJECT\". Pressing any of these buttons will update the designation at the bottom of the character tile. (These updates to the character inventory are not saved to the project until you click the SAVE button at the bottom of the page.) At the bottom of the panel is a Find-and-Replace tool. If every occurrence of the character should be replaced with something else, type the replacement character or string in the \"Replace with\" box and click the APPLY button. Important The find-and-replace operation makes changes to entries, not to the character inventory. It cannot be undone!","title":"Data Cleanup"},{"location":"goals.html#data-cleanup-goals","text":"","title":"Data Cleanup / Goals"},{"location":"goals.html#review-entries","text":"The Review Entries table shows all entries in a project.","title":"Review Entries"},{"location":"goals.html#sorting-and-filtering-columns","text":"The columns are: Actions, Vernacular, Senses, Glosses, Domains, Pronunciations, Note, Flag, and Delete.

Create a Project Import Existing Data If you have linguistics data in a LIFT file (likely exported from The Combine, WeSay , FLEx , or Lexique Pro ), you can hit the BROWSE button next to \"Upload existing data?\" to import the data into your project. Vernacular and Analysis Language The vernacular language is the language for which words are being collected. This is usually a local, indigenous, minority, autochthonous, heritage, or endangered language or dialect. The analysis language is the primary language into which the vernacular language is being translated. This is usually a regional, national, official, or majority language of the location where the vernacular is used. Alternate analysis languages can be added after project creation (see below ). Manage a Project When a project has been created or selected, it becomes the active project\u2014you should see a gear icon and/or the project name in the middle of the App Bar at the top of The Combine. Clicking on the gear icon or project name brings up Project Settings for managing the project. The following settings are available for project users with sufficient permissions. Project Name A distinguishing and descriptive name is recommended. The project name is part of the filename when you export your project. Project Languages The vernacular language specified at project creation is fixed. There may be multiple analysis languages associated with the project, but only the top one in the list is associated with new data entries. Note If the project has glosses in multiple languages, those languages must be added here for all the glosses to show up in data cleanup . Click the magnifying glass icon to see all language codes present in the project. The semantic domains language controls the language in which semantic domain titles and descriptions are displayed in Data Entry . Import and Export Note Currently, the maximum size of Lift files supported for import is 250MB. Note Currently, only one LIFT file can be imported per project. After clicking the Export button, you can navigate to other parts of the website. A download icon will appear in the App Bar when the export is ready for download. The default filename is the project name with a timestamp affixed. Important A project that has reached hundreds of MB in size may take multiple minutes to export. Autocomplete The default setting is On: When a user is entering the vernacular form of a new entry in Data Entry, this setting gives suggestions of similar existing entries, allowing the user to select an existing entry and add a new sense to that entry, rather than creating a (mostly) duplicate to something previously entered. (This does not effect the gloss spelling suggestions, which are based on a dictionary independent of existing project data.) Definitions Due to the nature of Rapid Word Collection, Data Entry in The Combine supports glosses instead of definitions. However, if you have imported a project in which senses also have definitions, this setting can enable definition support in Data Cleanup .

If you are the project owner, you can click this to open a user management menu with the following options: Remove from Project; Make/Remove Admin; Make Owner (if they are a project admin). Important There is only one Owner per project. If you \"Make Owner\" another user, you will move from Owner to Admin for the project and no longer be able to make/remove Admin on other users or archive the project. Add Users Either search existing users (shows all users with the search term in their name, username, or email address), or invite new users by email address (they will be automatically added to the project when they make an account via the invitation).
